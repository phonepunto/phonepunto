bash scripts/quick-audit.sh       # Linux/Mac
scripts\quick-audit.bat            # Windows

# Or invoke the skill directly
"Review this code for security issues"
"Check for bugs and vulnerabilities"
"Analyze this PR"
```

### What This Skill Does

## 🛡️ Research Backing

### OWASP Standards

- **OWASP Code Review Guide 2025** - Official review methodology
- **OWASP Top 10 2021** - Current security standard
- **CWE Top 25 2024** - Most dangerous software weaknesses

### Industry Research

- **Google Research (2018):** 9M code reviews analyzed
  - Median review latency: < 4 hours
  - 200-400 LOC optimal for catching defects
- **Microsoft Research (2013):** 900+ developers surveyed
  - Code review finds 60-70% of defects
  - Best defect detection rate at 200-400 LOC
- **Empirical Study (2024):** 135,560 code review comments analyzed
  - Reviewers caught security issues in 35/40 weakness categories
  - Most missed: Memory errors, resource management

### Key Finding

Teams with **continuous code review** fix vulnerabilities **92% faster** than batch reviews.

---

## 🎯 Review Focus (Balanced Quality + Security)

- **50% Security** - OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities, authentication
- **30% Code Quality** - Maintainability, standards, duplication
- **20% Performance** - N+1 queries, algorithm complexity, bundle size

## 📊 Severity Classification

### 🔴 Critical (Blocks Deployment)

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Hardcoded secrets/API keys
- Remote code execution risks

**Action:** STOP. Must fix immediately.

### 🟠 High (Fix Within 48 Hours)

- Missing authentication checks
- Insecure session management
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- N+1 query problems in critical paths

**Action:** Create blocker ticket. Fix before next deployment.

### 🟡 Medium (Fix This Sprint)

- Missing input validation
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) on small datasets)
- Code duplication
- Missing error handling

**Action:** Create ticket. Fix within current sprint.

### 🔵 Low (Backlog)

- Code style violations
- Minor performance optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation improvements

**Action:** Optional. Add to backlog.

## 📊 Metrics to Track

**From 2025 Research:**

1. **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)**
   - Target: < 7 days for high severity
   - Critical issues: < 24 hours

2. **Defect Density**
   - Formula: (# of bugs) / (1000 lines of code)
   - Target: < 1.0 defects per 1000 LOC

3. **Review Coverage**
   - Target: 100% of changed lines reviewed

4. **False Positive Rate**
   - Track your project's rate to calibrate trust in automated tools
